You are a talented freelancer with the opportunity to work on various projects, each requiring one day for completion and offering a specific payout. However, you want to maximize your earnings while adhering 
to the constraint that you can only work within a week (7 days). 
Your goal is to select a combination of projects within this one-week timeframe that yields the maximum profit.

Input:

An array of project objects, where each object contains the following properties:

deadline: The day by which the project must be completed (an integer from 1 to 7).
payment: The amount you will be paid for completing the project (a positive integer).

Output:

The maximum profit that can be earned by selecting the optimal combination of projects within the one-week timeframe.

{deadline:2,payment:1},
{deadline:2,payment:2}]
